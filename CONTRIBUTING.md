# How to Contribute to Acorn

Thank-you for your interest in helping to improve Acorn. As you might have guessed, this software was developed by someone (me) with little formal training in computer science. Acorn consequently violates many good programming practices. For this, I apologize.

I am likewise inexperienced with collaborating on software projects. For this reason, I have not defined processes for community involvement, even though such participation would be welcomed. 

If you are still interested in contributing to Acorn after reading the above, please contact me via email at danboyne (at) gmail-dot-com.

With sincere thanks,

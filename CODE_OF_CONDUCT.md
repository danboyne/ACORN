# Code of Conduct

Thank-you for your interest in helping to develop the Acorn software. 

As the owner of a new GitHub project, I defer to GitHub's [Community Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct). As needed, this Acorn-specific **Code of Conduct** will be updated. 

Sincerely,

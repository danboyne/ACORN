            Acorn is an open-source software utility for routing wires (nets) in microelectronic
            systems, including the top layer of a silicon chip, the surrounding package, and
            the printed-circuit board (PCB). Routing software is often optimized for only one of
            these three domains. However, system-level architects must ensure that physical
            connectivity can be achieved within and between <B><I>each</I></B> of these domains, in
            addition to satisfying system-level electrical performance requirements. Simply achieving
            connectivity can require weeks or months of engineering effort, with experts in each
            domain iteratively adjusting their physical designs using specialized software tools.

            <P>To address system-level connectivity, the Acorn utility was developed for routing nets
            from the silicon chipâ€™s upper wiring layers to regions on the PCB, including the intervening
            package. Given the person-weeks of effort often required for traditional chip/package/PCB
            co-design, this utility prioritizes capability over speed. This proof-of-concept version
            achieves full connectivity within four days for an industry-like routing configuration
            that include a PCB, a ball-grid-array (BGA) package with a C4-bumped chip, and coarse
            routing on the silicon chip. The rip-up-and-reroute algorithm employs A* ("<I>A star</I>")
            pathfinding in a three-dimensional, grid-based array; negotiated congestion that dissipates
            over time, similar to inverted ant colony optimization (ACO); and concepts borrowed from
            simulated annealing to avoid local minima in the routing cost.
